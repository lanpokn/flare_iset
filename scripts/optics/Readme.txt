About the Optical Image (oi) and the Optics

The relationship between the optical image and the optics is this.

The optical image is a specific image that is created by taking a scene and transforming it by the optics.

The optics is independent of the image.  We can apply the same optics to many different scenes.

When we create an optical image, it has a spatial sampling resolution, a wavelength sampling resolution, and a definition of the scene optics.  The optical image also has a field of view.

The optics has properties such as an F/# and focal length and so forth.  We attach the optics to the optical image to keep a record of how the optical image (which is an irradiance image) is formed.

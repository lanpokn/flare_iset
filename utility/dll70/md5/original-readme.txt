This is the readme file along with the MD5 utility for Matlab.

These are the files that are with this utility besides this readme file

1. md5.exe (for Windows 95 - XP)
2. md5.m
3. md5exe.html (description of the command line utility of md5.exe)

This utility can be used to check changes in a file (for signature, corruption after data transfer, etc...)

Typically, I would copy all the MD5 sums of a files on a CD and store them in my computer and once in a while
I would compare the MD5 sums of the files on the CD with those in my computer to detect any corruption.
